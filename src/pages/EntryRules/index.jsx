            <strong>IMAGE AND ENTRY REQUIREMENTS </strong> This exhibition is
            open to anyone; however, an entry may be rejected when the Sponsor
            or the Exhibition Organizers, in their reasonable discretion,
            believes the entry does not conform to exhibition rules and these
            Conditions of Entry. Membership in any photographic organization is
            not required. <br/> <br/>
            Sanctions: Entries will not be accepted from any
            entrant who is currently sanctioned by PSA. <br/> <br/>
            PSA Star Ratings To <br/>

            receive proper Star ratings credit from PSA, entrants must provide
            their names and country exactly the same in each exhibition. Aliases
            are not permitted. Please contact PSA in the event of name changes
            or relocating to another country. Using one’s name differently in
            different exhibition exposes the entrant to the risk that many of
            their acceptances may not be recognized by PSA Star Ratings <br/> <br/>
            
            Image Creation <br/> Entries must originate as photographs (image-captures of
            objects via light sensitivity) made by the entrant on photographic
            emulsion or acquired digitally. <br/>  <br/> 
            Certification: <br/>
            By virtue of
            submitting an image, the entrant certifies the work as his or her
            own (.Images may not incorporate elements produced by anyone else
            (for example: clip art, images or art by others downloaded from the
            Internet). Aliases are not allowed. The entrant permits the sponsors
            to reproduce all or part of the entered material free of charge for
            publication and/or display in media related to the exhibition. This
            may include low resolution posting on a website. Note: Entrants who
            indicate that their images may not be reproduced or used “will not
            be eligible for awards” or inclusion in audio-visuals of the
            exhibition “and could be subject to disqualification” by the
            exhibition sponsors. The exhibition assumes no liability of any
            misuse of copyright <br/><br/> 
            
            Alteration and Computer Generation Subject to
            Divisional restrictions (particularly Nature, Photo Travel, and
            Photojournalism) images may be altered, either electronically or
            otherwise, by the maker. Adjustments to enhance images or creatively
            modify images are allowed providing the underlying photograph is
            retained in a way that is obvious to the viewer. Images may not be
            constructed entirely with a computer, and must be the sole work of
            the author <br/><br/> 
            
            Re-use of accepted images: Once an image has been
            accepted in this exhibition it may not be entered again in any
            future instances of this exhibition. It may, of course, be entered
            in any other PSA/FIAP recognised exhibitions but must always have
            the same title. <br/><br/> 
            
            Entry: An Entry consists of, up to and including,
            four (4) images entered by a single entrant into the same Section.
            An entrant may only enter a specific Section once. <br/><br/> 
            
            Titles: <br/> 
            Each image must have a unique title that is a description of the image.
            That unique title must be used for entry of that image or of an
            identical Image into any and all PSA-Recognized exhibitions. Titles
            must be 35 characters or fewer. No titles may be visible to the
            judges, and nothing in the image may identify the maker. Titles may
            not include file extensions such as .jpg or .jpeg (or any other
            camera capture filenames such as IMG 471). Titles may not consist of
            personal identifiers possibly augmented by a number; or include
            words such as “untitled” or “no title”. Titles may not consist
            solely of numbers unless those numbers are prominently contained
            within the image, such as a contestant number in a race.
